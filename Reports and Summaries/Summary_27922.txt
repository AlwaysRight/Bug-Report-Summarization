I pointed my update manager at 

http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/performance

but the tools were installed in the wrong location.
They were installed one
directory too deep.
For example:

U:\eclipse21\plugins\org.eclipse.core.tools_1.0.0\org.eclipse.core.tools_1.0.0Fixed.Cleaning up old defects.
