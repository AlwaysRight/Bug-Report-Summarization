In the file:

eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources\ant_tasks\resources-
ant_jar\org\eclipse\core\resources\ant\messages.properties

the translators have a problem with the following property strings:

copy.files=Copying {0} file{1} to {2}.
copy.result=Copied {0} empty director{1} to {2}.
It appears that the {1} in both strings is used to create plurality in cases 
where {0} is greater than one.
Since different languages handle this 
differently the translators are having a problem.
