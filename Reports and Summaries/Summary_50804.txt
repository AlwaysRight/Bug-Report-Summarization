Preferences can be loaded without loading a plugin, as this is what
Preferences.importPreferences/exportPreferences does.
We have a situation where we would like access to the Preference Store in a way
that does not require the loading or even the existence of a Plugin.
Ideally,
the functionality would be exposed in a way that we could (at least) look up
existing preferences using a plugin-id and preference name.
