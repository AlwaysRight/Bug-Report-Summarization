    <thetext>In the file:

eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources\ant_tasks\resources-
ant_jar\org\eclipse\core\resources\ant\messages.properties

the translators have a problem with the following property strings:

copy.files=Copying {0} file{1} to {2}.
copy.result=Copied {0} empty director{1} to {2}.

It appears that the {1} in both strings is used to create plurality in cases 
where {0} is greater than one.  Since different languages handle this 
differently the translators are having a problem.

How do we currently handle these types of situations in DBCS languages where 
this would also be a problem?  Is the source variable for {1} dependent on the 
value of {0}?  If so, can you provide the source variables so that I can pass 
that along to the translators?  And finally, is removing {1} from the string an 
acceptable solution for those languages which don't have different word endings 
for singular and pural nouns.

Thanks.</thetext>

    <thetext>Sigh.  Those message keys are unused, and have never been used as far as I can
tell.  They certainly aren't referenced in 3.0 or 3.1.  I have deleted them.  I
agree that it should not have been constructing the plural form of the noun that
way.

I guess your workaround is to not bother translating those messages.  Sorry for
the confusion.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for the update.  That was the answer I was hoping for :)
