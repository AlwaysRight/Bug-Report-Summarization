Using Eclipse V1, create a Java project outside of the default workspace.
Close the Java project, and exit Eclipse V1.
Bring up Eclipse V2 (M4 driver or later), pointing to the workspace above.
You 
will see the closed Java project.
Exit Eclipse V2.
Upon exiting Eclipse V2, a directory with the same name as the project will be 
created in the workspace (remember that the project's correct location is 
outside of the default workspace).
Within the directory is the .project file 
for that project.
