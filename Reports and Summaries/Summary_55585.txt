To enable the
seamless migration, we sometimes have to add natures and/or builders which are
not actually valid in the current version (for backward compatibility, we add
natures so that previous versions of the product will recognize them
appropriately).
We tolerate the presence of non-existent natures, but we
don't allow you to configure new natures that are missing (our contract requires
us to invoke IProjectNature.configure(), which we cannot do if the nature is
missing).
We have built a generic migration engine to ensure N-1 | N-2 compatibility with
previous versions of our product which is built on Eclipse.
When doing so we are seeing exceptions.
Is there a way to set
the nature and explicitly silence the error?
If not, we need this capability for
the final release of Eclipse 3.0.You see exceptions in the new version of the product or the old one?
What kinds
of exceptions are you seeing?
The only thing that should happen when a builder
is missing is an informational message in the log file once per session
mentioned that a missing builder was encountered and skipped.Closing - not enough info.
Please reopen with more details.We are using a 3.0 Integration Build from early March (03/04).
We get the following exception when setting the Project Description using a
nature ID that does not have a valid nature defined.
