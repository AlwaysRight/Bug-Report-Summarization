I have a large web project from WTP (infact the size of the project when compressed is 72mb)
That is the only project in my workspace.
I choose to delete it completely from the workspace
I find it takes like a minute to delete it and most of them time in progress view

the delete operation stays at 0% and then after a minute jumps to 99%

I even paused the product to see where it was executing it was here

Its probable the LocalFile class does not report progress granularly
