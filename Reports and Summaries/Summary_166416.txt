That was quick.
Don't have a repro, but thought the stack trace may be enough to go on...

[exec] java.lang.NullPointerException
     [exec]     at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.NatureManager.computeNatureEnablements(NatureManager.java:50)
     [exec]     at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.NatureManager.getEnabledNatures(NatureManager.java:332)
     [exec]     at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.NatureManager.isNatureEnabled(NatureManager.java:433)
     [exec]     at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Project.isNatureEnabled(Project.java:730)From inspecting the code, I see how this can happen if the project is deleted or closed concurrently in another thread.
