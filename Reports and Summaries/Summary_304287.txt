Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

2.
screenshot of the error.What does 'C:\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe -version' show in the DOS prompt?Is it a 32 bit VM or 64 bit VM?Hi,

 I solved it by starting the Eclipse this way:

[quote]G:\Tools\IDE\eclipse-SDK-3.5-win32-x86_64>eclipse1 -vm C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_18\bin\javaw.exe[/quote]

Hi,

Finally I solved it by starting the Eclipse this way:

    G:\Tools\IDE\eclipse-SDK-3.5-win32-x86_64>eclipse1 -vm C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_18\bin\javaw.exe



When I give java -version in my command prompt it gives:


    java version "1.6.0_18"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_18-b07)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.0-b13, mixed mode)



It has got something to do with the AMD processor as in the JDK folder(Though Still don't understand why)

C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_18\jre\lib\amd64 is a specific folder for AMD with jvm.cfg with the following:

-server KNOWN
-client IGNORE
-hotspot ALIASED_TO -server
-classic WARN
-native ERROR
-green ERROR
